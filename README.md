# Slide To Text

## todo
-- command line switch for lowercase
-- better output formatting
-- width restriction
-- nice output, like better slide demarcation
-- label each slide like 4 of 23
-- better naming, file, project, etc
-- allow individual file to
-- automate option to output a note to a directory
-- parallelize
-- take a list of files, so can use globs
-- making dirs and moving files into them is annoying
    -- should figure it out itself from names
    -- can read haruna conf?
-- use least surprising file/dir semantics
